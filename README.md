Link : [Narrative Visualization-How to be an Airbnb Superhost in Chicago](https://heyelyon.github.io/NarrativeViz/index)

### Messaging

The visualization is based on Airbnb data in Chicago area and aims to provide both the current market overview and suggestions based on that for potential hosts in Chicago. The background information is  designed to help user build up some basic knowledge about the Chicago market to be a host and then extended to figure out desired superhost behaviors to be a superhost. 
The message is: If you plan to be an Airbnb host in Chicago, loft could be a good choice due to high popularity and low supply. The popular types of room could differ from area to area (you could refer to chart on scene 2 for more detailed information).Remember to complete your listing information and try your best to be a superhost by increasing review popularity.

### Narrative Structure

The narrative visualization follows the effective structures of an interactive slideshow, where user exploration is allowed at all of the scenes of the story. There is one dropdown list as well as the tooltips for charts available for user to explore further. But the main path is fixed from knowing step by step about the Chicago Market (be a host) to "be a superhost".
